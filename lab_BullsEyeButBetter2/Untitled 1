Make a loop for printing circles using a variable like malnum that can be scaled between the circles and if loop to see wether to make it white or red

The biggest circle would have to remain the same bc the screen can't get bigger for the number of rings

Make the scaling factor larger the more rings are inputed into the code bc the distance between the rings needs to be smaller

Check wether the number of times the code has run is odd or even and change between red and white depending on that
